# dsh Codex

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Use a ChatGPT subscription in [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) through OpenAI's Codex sign-in flow—no OpenAI Platform API key required and no dsh source patch required.

`dsh-codex` is an independent dsh bundle. It adds:

- multiple ChatGPT OAuth accounts from dsh Settings, with automatic token refresh and account-aware scheduling
- the Codex GPT catalog, including vision-capable models when the account offers them
- streaming, tool calls, reasoning replay, prompt caching, and dsh compaction through the normal LLM service
- Codex standalone web search through dsh's existing `web_search` tool
- optional HTTP(S) URL input added to Harness's existing `read_image` tool
- an `imagegen` tool backed by `gpt-image-2`, with workspace or conversation reference images and automatic workspace output
- browser image input through dsh's existing paste and drop controls

ChatGPT subscription authentication and usage-based OpenAI API access are different products. This plugin uses the ChatGPT Codex backend only; it does not turn a subscription into a general-purpose OpenAI API credential.

## Install

Install the prebuilt bundle from npm into the selected dsh profile:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-codex
dsh web
```

From a DeepSeek Harness source checkout, use `pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-codex`. A local plugin checkout can still be installed with `link:/absolute/path/to/dsh-codex` for development.

Open **Settings → OpenAI Codex → Add ChatGPT account**. Each authorization adds or refreshes one account without signing out the others. The account page lists every account separately, supports targeted removal, and shows each account's live Codex quota bars and exact remaining percentages; exact credit balances or workspace limits appear only when the account API supplies them. Requests are leased through `dsh-multiprovider`, with session affinity and health-aware cooldowns so one exhausted or failing account does not disable the others.

The CLI remains available for terminal and headless installations:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-openai-codex login
dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-openai-codex login --device-code
dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-openai-codex status
dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-openai-codex logout
```

For `dsh-tui`, install the bundle into the same profile:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile dsh-tui add dsh-codex
```

After restarting the TUI, `/model` lists the `openai-codex` catalog. With no explicit route or saved selection, the TUI adopts the bundle's `gpt-5.6-sol` default. Use `/codex status|login|logout|usage|config` for the compatibility account and live settings; the four boolean settings can be changed with `/codex set <read-image|imagegen-other-models|websocket-context|native-compaction> <on|off>`. The Settings page is the multi-account management surface; the CLI compatibility account participates in the same request pool.

Codex, Claude Code, and other automation agents should follow [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). It is a complete, idempotent runbook and does not require reading this repository's source or design notes.

The bundle selects `openai-codex` / `gpt-5.6-sol` for new agents and selects the Codex search provider. A model already saved in dsh settings still takes precedence; the model picker can select any other Codex model visible to the signed-in account.

## Images

Image support uses dsh's durable attachment path:

- paste an image into the Web composer with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>, or drag and drop it;
- on Windows, paste a clipboard image with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> in the adapted dsh-tui, or enter `@relative/image.png`; clipboard images go straight to the attachment store, while path images use the active workspace filesystem;
- ask the model to call `read_image` with either `file_path` for a workspace image or `url` for an HTTP(S) image;
- PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF are accepted within the active dsh attachment limits;
- only a model that explicitly advertises image input may receive an image.

`imagegen` is available to any vision-capable conversation model. The current model writes an ordinary prompt and may select either `referenced_image_paths` or `num_last_images_to_include`; the plugin reads the bytes from `ctx.fs` or the attachment store and sends them to `gpt-image-2`. The model never emits base64. Every result is shown inline, saved as a durable attachment, and written to the active workspace. `output_path` chooses the destination; omitting it creates a unique `generated-<timestamp>-<id>.png` file. Local saving is included in this plugin, while `dsh-remote-ssh` supplies the remote AHP write path when that plugin owns the workspace.

The Settings page has separate **Enhance read_image** and **Image generation for other models** toggles. Both default on. Turning off the first removes the plugin's agent-scoped override and restores Harness's original local-only `read_image` schema. Turning off the second keeps `imagegen` available to Codex vision models and rejects calls from other model providers at execution time.

`read_image` stores validated bytes as a dsh attachment before returning the actual image block. Local paths are delegated unchanged to Harness, including its configured filesystem and sandbox behavior. The URL extension bounds redirects and bytes and rejects credentials embedded in URLs.

## Search

The provider connects dsh's `web_search` tool to the standalone search protocol used by Codex. It returns ordinary dsh text and HTTP(S) citations, so later turns and compaction retain the tool history.

Configure the `llm-openai-codex` row in a profile patch:

```yaml
- id: llm-openai-codex
  config:
    searchMode: live
    searchContextSize: medium
```

| Field | Default | Values |
|---|---:|---|
| `searchModel` | `gpt-5.6-sol` | a Codex model id |
| `searchMode` | `cached` | `cached`, `indexed`, `live` |
| `searchContextSize` | `medium` | `low`, `medium`, `high` |
| `searchMaxOutputTokens` | `10000` | positive integer |

Each resolved, secret-free auxiliary request is recorded before dispatch as the dedicated `web/openai-codex-search-llm-request` session event. The event is owned and registered by this plugin; no generic search event or dsh fork is required.

## Responses API experiments

The Settings page provides two Codex-only switches. Both are off by default:

- **WebSocket context reuse** keeps `store: false` and selects pi-ai's Codex WebSocket continuation transport. While the same session keeps a reusable connection and the next request is an exact extension, it sends `previous_response_id` with only the new input. History edits, compaction, Fork, connection loss, and process restarts fall back to a full request. With the switch off, ordinary turns use SSE and always send the full Harness context.
- **Native Responses compaction** sends dsh summarization calls to `codex/responses/compact`. Its encrypted compaction item is retained inside the Harness checkpoint and restored as native Responses input on later Codex requests. Existing checkpoints remain readable after the switch is disabled. Compact endpoint errors are reported directly; turn the switch off to return to the existing dsh model summary.

The switches are independent. Every ordinary Codex request keeps `store: false`; the default uses SSE with the text-summary path from `dsh-compaction-basic`.

## Credentials and privacy

dsh keeps this login separate from Codex CLI/Desktop:

- the CLI compatibility account remains at `$DSH_HOME/.openai-codex-auth.json` (`~/.dsh` by default);
- additional accounts use owner-only files under `$DSH_HOME/openai-codex-accounts/`, named by a one-way stable account identifier;
- writes are atomic and token refresh is locked across local dsh processes;
- browser status and diagnostics never return token values;
- `~/.codex/auth.json` is never copied or modified.

Each account has its own credential store and lease, preventing two requests from racing the same rotating refresh token. Scheduler state and browser responses contain only stable ids, labels, health, and quota metadata—not credentials. Removing the bundle does not delete credentials; use targeted removal in Settings or `logout` for the CLI compatibility account.

## Compatibility notes

- The plugin runs on released dsh plugin surfaces and does not require a modified Harness checkout. It can generate attachments and save local output when installed alone.
- ChatGPT plan eligibility, model access, quotas, and backend behavior are controlled by OpenAI and may change.
- The Codex endpoint does not enforce the ordinary Responses `max_output_tokens` field. Compaction works, but its configured summary cap cannot be imposed server-side on this route.
- Filesystem, shell, skills, MCP, subagents, permissions, attachments, compaction, and the `web_search` tool itself still come from the active dsh profile.
- The standalone search endpoint is not a public OpenAI Platform API. Compatibility follows the pinned Codex/pi-ai implementation.

See [the design document](docs/design.md) for protocol, persistence, and lifecycle details.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run check
```

The check performs strict Host and browser TypeScript checking, focused tests, and both runtime bundles.
